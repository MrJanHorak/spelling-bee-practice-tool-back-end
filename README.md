# Spelling Bee Training Tool

My elementary school daughter recently came home after competing in her schools spelling bee. In the excitement of the moment of having faired so much better than last year she said next year I want to win! 

That inspired me to see if I could design a tool to help her prepare. 

## Current plan and goal:
* grade level appropriate word lists to practice
* word definitions in style of spelling bee
* have app speak words to student
* ability to reveal the word after trying to spell it first
* [ice box] have app listen (and recognise) spelling
* enlarge vocabulary to practice as student progresses
* setting for practicing 'older' already learned words for review
* setting for learning just new words
* graphical display of progress?
* create way of tracking how well a word has been learned

## Next (first steps)
* create wireframe
* create data models
* determine MVP goal
